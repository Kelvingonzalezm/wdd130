                    If rush rush, shouting and hot vibes are your thing, then look no further 
                    than our <br>Rapids Fall. This location is reserved for the strong hearted and 
                    is one of the <br>places where you get to feel first hand, the maximum excitment 
                    and fun of water <br>rafting. Its never a dull moment here. Rapids Falls takes 
                    you to the extremity of <br>water rafting. Here, you get toride through some of the 
                    biggest rapids around in <br>the smallest raft where your guide depends solely on 
                    you. You will run along <br>some of the fastest rapids including the great 
                    Tuttl's Tumble, tombstone etc. Just <br>as soon as the rapids ends and you think 
                    it's over, we take you back again even to <br>a more challenging line. The smaller 
                    rafts here makes the rapids more <br>challenging and are perfect for small groups 
                    of 3 to 6. Thinking of coming here, <br>do keep in mind that Rapids 
                    Fall is only appropriate for skilled swimmers as <br>flips and involuntary swims 
                    are as common as dirts here. Tickets are available <br>anytime for purchase both online 
                    and in person.
